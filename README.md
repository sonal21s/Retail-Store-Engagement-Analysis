# Retail-Store-Engagement-Analysis
This project analyses retail transaction data for a UK supermarket chain to compare regional sales performance and customer behaviour. The goal is to identify the store with the strongest growth potential to support a targeted marketing investment.
Caveat: Due to limited historical and marketing data, the analysis relies exclusively on transactional sales data. The goal is not to select the highest-revenue store, but to identify the region with the greatest potential for incremental growth based on customer behaviour and performance trends.

## Project Objectives
- Compare sales and customer performance across regions and stores
- Analyse customer behaviour, loyalty, and retention trends
- Identify regional growth opportunities beyond current store size
- Develop and justify relevant KPIs using SQL
- Provide insights through clear dashboards and analysis

## Data Coverage
- July 2020 – March 2022

## Tools Used
- SQL (analytics & transformations)
- Tableau (visualizations)
- Git (version control)

## Key KPIs
- Annual revenue & transactions
- Sales per customer
- Sales per transaction
- Quarterly growth
- New vs loyal customers
- Cohort retention
- Top-performing departments

## Key Insights
- London generates the highest revenue and transaction volume
- Customer spend per transaction is highest in London
- New customer acquisition declined across all stores
- Birmingham shows the strongest retention rate
- Nottingham shows weaker long-term customer value

## Recommendation
While London delivers the highest current performance, Birmingham presents the strongest opportunity for marketing investment due to higher retention and greater potential for customer growth.
